// all threads at once from different threads suspend each other and the game
// hangs, before its window appears when it happens at start-up. The mutex is
// named per process and shared by every plugin that takes it around its
// thread freezes; a holder suspended by a plugin that does not take it is
// waited for only so long, then the freeze goes ahead.
